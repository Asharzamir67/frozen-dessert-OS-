In todayâ€™s fast-paced retail environment, managing a frozen dessert facility such as an ice cream shop demands meticulous attention to stock control and inventory management. To address this, we embarked on a project aimed at creating a simulation of an ice cream shop that leverages operating system principles. This simulation was designed to efficiently manage inventory and enhance customer service by illustrating the critical role of threads and system calls. By simulating the interactions between customers and service counters, our project highlights how operating system frameworks can prevent race conditions and ensure resource synchronization.
